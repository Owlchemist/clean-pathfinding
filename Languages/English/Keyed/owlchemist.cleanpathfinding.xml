	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias.Desc>Since stone terrain does not generate filth, the above setting may cause pawns be overly attracted to walking upon it, depending on the map layout. You can tinker with this setting if you're trying to avoid this behavior.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias.Desc>
